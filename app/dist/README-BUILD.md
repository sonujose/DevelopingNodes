## BUILD FOLDER FOR WEBPACK CHUNKS

#### All the generated chunks after the webpack build will be generated in this folder. Corresponding source maps are also loaded (which helps for debugging).
- vendor chunk : `vendor.bundle.js`
- app chunk : `app.bundle.js`
- styles chunk : `styles.bundle.css`

These chunks are loaded in the browser for necessary files
